This library provides a Downhill Collider algorithm, which aims at merging elements together depending on some similarity measures. Still this is not exactly what we do here, one can compared it to a snowball sampling (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_sampling): little snowballs are rolling downhill and merge together when they collide (touch each other). At the end, one or several big snowballs remain, which are completely separated and so could not collide.

It is not a clustering algorithm, in the sense that it does not group the elements in several sets, but merge them together (each grouping results in a single element which represents all the grouped elements). It can be used as such if the balls are actually sets, which means that these sets will be merged together, producing a clustering. But it is a specific algorithm which can manage only certain types of clustering, not all of them.
